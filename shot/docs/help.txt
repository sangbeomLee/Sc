Usage: shot [options]
Takes screenshots of your desktop.

Basic options

    -h, --help          Shows this help.
    -o, --output PATH   Saves the target image in PATH. The default file name
                        is of the form "yyyymmdd_hhiiss_rrr.png", where "r" is
                        a random character (example: 20150721_103014_ukd.png),
                        and the file is placed in current working directory.
                        If the PATH ends with /, it will be appended with
                        default file name. Target directory needs to exist
                        prior to invocation.
                        Currently, only PNG format is supported.
    -c, --clipboard     Puts the target image in the system clipboard.
                        Overrides --output. Available only on Windows.
        --list          Lists all monitors and exits.
    -v, --version       Shows shot's version and exists.

Options specific to screenshot regions

    By default, the region is equivalent to --desktop.

    -d, --desktop        Takes region from the area bounding all monitors.
    -r, --region REGION  Takes region from string. REGION needs to be of form
                         WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y or WIDTHxHEIGHT.
    -m, --monitor NUM    Takes region from NUM-th monitor.
    -w, --window NUM     Takes region from window with id NUM.
    -M, --active-monitor Takes region from the currently active monitor.
    -W, --active-window  Takes region from the currently active window.
    -i, --interactive    Creates a resizable and movable window, whose final
                         position and size will be used to derive the region.

Controlling interactive region picker

    The interactive region picker's window can be moved with left mouse button
    and resized with right mouse button. Following keyboard shortcuts are also
    available:

        h, left             Moves left by DELTA.
        k, up               Moves up by DELTA.
        j, down             Moves down by DELTA.
        l, right            Moves right by DELTA.

        ctrl+h, ctrl+left   Shrinks horizontally by DELTA.
        ctrl+k, ctrl+up     Shrinks vertically by DELTA.
        ctrl+j, ctrl+down   Grows horizontally by DELTA.
        ctrl+l, ctrl+right  Grows vertically by DELTA.

        esc, q              Cancels (exits without taking a screenshot).
        enter               Confirms selection and takes a screenshot.

    DELTA is equal to 25px by default, and 1px when shift key is pressed.

    By default, the interactive region picker starts with a 640x480 rectangle
    centered on the primary monitor. This can be controlled by prepending other
    region arguments before -i. For example, "shot -W -i" will create
    interactive region picker whose initial location and size is set to that of
    the currently focused window.

Examples

    shot --list

        Doesn't take a screenshot and lists monitors instead.

    shot -W --output=/home/sseagal/

        Takes a screenshot of focused window and saves it to /home/sseagal/.
